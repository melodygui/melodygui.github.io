Welcome to your new Jekyll blog! This is your first post, and it's here to help you get started with the Mosaic theme.

## Getting Started

This post demonstrates the basic structure of a blog post in Jekyll. Each post is written in Markdown format and includes front matter (the section between the `---` lines at the top) that defines metadata about the post.

### What You Can Customize

- **Title**: The main heading of your post
- **Date**: When the post was published
- **Tags**: Categories to help organize your content
- **Reading Time**: Estimated time to read the post
- **Excerpt**: A brief summary that appears on the homepage

## Writing Your Posts

Jekyll supports Markdown, which makes writing formatted content easy:

- Create **bold text** with `**bold text**`
- Add *italic text* with `*italic text*`
- Make lists like this one
- Add links like [this link to Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)

### Code Examples

You can also include code snippets:

```javascript
function greetBlogReader(name) {
    console.log(`Hello, ${name}! Welcome to the blog!`);
}

greetBlogReader("Reader");
```

## Next Steps

1. Replace this post with your own content
2. Customize the `_config.yml` file with your information
3. Update the about page with your story
4. Start writing about topics you're passionate about!

Happy blogging!
